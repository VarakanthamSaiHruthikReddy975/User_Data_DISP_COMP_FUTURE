# Retrieving User data from CSV File using Asynchrnous operations

## Introduction
This project is designed to provide an overview on how to get data from an csv file using various asynchrnous customization and operations like Executor and CompletableFuture concepts. It aims to solve the easier access of data by using multiple threads that are constanly working together to display data to the user. We've used asynchronous programming instead of synchronous programming approach to maintain concurrency of operations in getting 1000's of rows of data from the CSV file for better performance and efficiency.
